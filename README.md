## Issues

We ran into a limitation of the OMDB API where we could only search the API if the hero name matched the name of the title. An example: Guardians of the Galaxy would not show if the user searched Star-Lord. Being able to search the API to find a match in the plot instead of title would have solved this problem.

Couldnt access specific pages of documentation unless google searched it specifically. There was not way to access it through the website normally.
